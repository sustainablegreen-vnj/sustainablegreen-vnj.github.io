            We as a society consume a high amount of energy in the form of electricity and fuel (1). We also consume a lot of water globally (2). In a nutshell, we consume a lot of important and vital resources. Without energy, our cities would collapse and run like cavemen. Without water, we all would die.

Not all the world has access to these resources though. Africa is one such place where clean and drinkable water is unobtanium (3, 4). Clean water is very scarce in Africa. We should be thankful that we have readily available clean and drinkable water, but some people waste water as if water is an everyday thing everywhere in the world. Wasting water is not appreciating the fact that we have clean and drinkable water. We should be grateful for it. 

We can appreciate our access to water and energy by not wasting it. How can we not waste it, you may ask? Well, by limiting our usage of energy and water. EWLimit = Limiting energy and water usage.

How can we limit our energy usage? Well, for once we can turn off the lights when we arenâ€™t using them. For example, we can turn off the lights when we leave a room empty. Another one is not using air conditioning when the room is not hot. 

How can we limit our water usage too? For once, we can shower instead of using a bathtub, as a shower uses less water to clean us than a bathtub to fill up and clean (5, 6). We also should not forget to turn off water taps when we are not using them, such as when we are scrubbing our hands during washing.
