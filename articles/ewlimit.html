            We probably have heard about 3G before right? If you haven't, well it stands for Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. 
            Everyday in our lives, we have always produced trash, wheter we realize it or not. Infact, from many sources, 
            we produce on average over 2 kilograms of waste in a day. With over 8 billion people, that is 16 billion kilograms or 16 million tons of waste.
