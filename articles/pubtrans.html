            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all go somewhere in our day to day life don’t we? We go to work, school and basically anywhere with cars don’t we? Our cities are so big that walking is basically impractical. We rely on vehicles in our daily lives. 

2024 has a chance to be the peak for carbon emissions. This means that from 2025 onwards, carbon emissions will finally decrease. 
While we are currently transitioning to electric vehicles, most of us are still using fossil-fuel powered combustion vehicles. These fossil-fuel combustion vehicles are producing greenhouse gasses such as nitrogen dioxide (1), which are not good for our home planet Earth.
