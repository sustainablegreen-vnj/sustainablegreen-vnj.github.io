            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all go somewhere in our day to day life don’t we? 
            We go to work, school and basically anywhere with cars don’t we? Our cities are 
            so big that walking is basically impractical. We rely on vehicles in our daily 
            lives, and that can have some really bad long term effects. Some of those include:

        <p class="yipity">However, not all is bad. 2024 has the chance to be the peak for global carbon emissions. 
            This means that there is a chance from 2025 onwards, carbon emissions will 
            finally start to decrease. <br>
        </p>

            While we are currently (2024) transitioning to electric vehicles, most of us are still 
            using fossil-fuel powered combustion vehicles. These fossil-fuel combustion 
            vehicles are producing greenhouse gasses such as nitrogen dioxide(NO₂), which aren't 
            good for Earth. As we continue to rely on these fossil-fuel combustion vehicles, 
            the gasses they produce, like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
            contribute significantly to climate change and air pollution. These gasses 
            damage the ozone Earth's atmosphere, trapping heat in our atmosphere, thereby 
            causing global warming. These gasses also harm human health by attacking our 
            respiratory and cardiovascular systems.<br>
            <br>
            However, it's still not over yet. There are still many ways you can reduce the
            harm of fossil fuels. 
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce personal use vehicles
                    Rather than using personal vehicles, try using busses, or even the MRT or LRT.
                    Indonesia's infrastructure has been developing extremely fast, and as a side bonus 
                    it's extremely cheap. You can also use a bike or walk to get to places, and those 
                    options are healthy, too!
                </li>
                <li>Choose cleaner alternatives
                    Whenever possible, transition into electric or hybrid vehicles. While this can be
                    an extremely expensive investment, however the tax for owning an electric vehicle (EV)
                    are reduced significantly. 
                </li>
                <li>Offset your carbon footprint
                    Plant trees, volunteer into a corporation that helps the environment, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Raise awareness
                    If none of those options stated above simply can't be feasible, or if you wanted to make
                    a greater change, simply telling others, wether it be friends, family, neighbors, anyone can
                    help. Remember, it's not about how much you can change at once, sometimes the only thing 
                    that can really matter are the consistent little things.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Change isn't something that happens overnight, so the slightest amount of change everyday will eventually
            add up.
