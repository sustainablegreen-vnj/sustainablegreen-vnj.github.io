            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know that back in the 1970s, America was obsessed with asbestos?
            Asbestos is a group of minerals that are resistant to heat and chemicals. They are also made out of long thin fibers. Asbestos was
            commonly used because of those properties, and the fact that it was strong made it extremely useful in creating
            building materials (like insulation) and automobile parts. However, asbestos is also a carcinogen (a substance that can cause cancer). 
            Asbestos also works very slowly, sometimes taking around 40 years or more after the
            initial exposure to it. This will be important later on.<br><br><!--Where connection-->

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plastic is a word that originally meant “pliable and easily shaped.” It only recently became a name for a 
            category of materials called polymers. Plastic is everywhere, in everything. With how convenient plastic can
            be and with how cheap it is, it's hard to assume many corporations won't not use plastic. <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microplastics are small particles of plastics that are sourced from the degradation of much larger pieces of plastic.
            These plastic pieces are usually found almost everywhere, however it's more commonly found in the ocean. This is
            because most trash are dumped straight into the ocean. These dumping cause serious damage for the marine ecosystem,
            it gets ingested by the fishes, birds, and other marine life. These effects cause serious long term damages, if not
            addressed immediately. <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With microplastics being everywhere, in everything, it wouldn't be a surprise if we don't find it in ourselves. Microplastics,
            wether you want it or not can be found in every single part of the human body. In fact, a research by the University of Rhode Island 
            College of Pharmacy has found that microplastics are found in a mice's brain. This is also the same in humans, microplastics
            can make up 0.48% to 0.5% of the brains weight. There are so many health problems regarding microplastics, and in some cases,
            can lead to cancer.<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reveals a concerning pattern, humanity has a reliance on materials that was once deemed revolutionary, next deemed dangerous.
            Just as asbestos was once seen as a versatile material, used almost everywhere, plastic has also been integrated in our daily lives. However, the long
            term dangers far outshine the short term benefits, and we need to replace plastic before it can get worse. By learning from the past,
            we can address this problem immediately, before it becomes a larger problem.<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can we actually fix this problem? Well, we can:
            <ul class="yap2">
                <li>Reduce plastic use,</li>
                <li>Raise awareness, like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promote biodegradable alternatives,</li>
                    <li>Educate friends, family,</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Support researches about recyclable plastic</li>
            </ul>
